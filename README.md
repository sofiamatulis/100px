## This is a  simple web app to showcase the Top 100 photos from 500px website. It also lets the user log in through their 500px account and like photos.

 Gems that were used:

* 1) F00px: F00px is a ruby API gem that helps and simplifies the process with methods to pull the 500px latest 100 photos into the web app.


* 2) Omniauth-500px: Omniauth handles the authentication process since it lets the user log in with their 500px credentials and gives the app a token back, and with that token can act in behalf of that user. This token is used by the app to perform  actions on the userâ€™s behalf (for example, to like a photo).


* 3) Figaro: Figaro makes it easier to configure the application in a secure method.
