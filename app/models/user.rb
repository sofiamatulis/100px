#find_or_create_by makes sure that the user is not created many times
#the method stores all the required data, saves the user, and returns it.

#self to be able to access this in the sessions controller (class method)

# after I get a user info, I have a class method find_by that checks User model for info,
# if there is , I login, if not create a new user in the database
